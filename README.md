# JAVA-OOPCourseProject
OOP course java project - arkanoid game.

This is an Arkanoid game that I made as part of a Java Object-Oriented Programming course at the University.
The final version, which I posted, is the sixth part of this project.
This project requires many Object-Oriented skills, including files - in order to keep your score after a game.
