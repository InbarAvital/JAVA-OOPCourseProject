# JAVA-OOPCourseProject
OOP course java project - arkanoid game.

This is an Arkanoid game that I made as part of a Java Object-Oriented Programming course at the University.
The final version, which I posted, is the sixth part of this project.
This project requires many Object-Oriented skills, including files - in order to keep your score after a game.

Notice that I also posted a zip file in case you are interested in downloading the game.
In addition, there are also the files seperated as they are in the zip file for you to read the code.

Enjoy!

-note: After losing/winning in a game, click space in order to go back to the menu.-
